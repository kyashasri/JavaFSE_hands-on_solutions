# Hands-on 4: Difference Between JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA

## Java Persistence API (JPA)
-JPA is like a set of rules for saving Java objects into a database.
-It is just a specification, which means it doesnâ€™t have real code.

## Hibernate
- Hibernate is a tool that follows the JPA rules.
-It has the actual code to connect Java objects to the database.
- Requires manual session and transaction management.


## Spring Data JPA
-Spring Data JPA makes things easier and shorter.
-It works on top of JPA and uses Hibernate inside.
